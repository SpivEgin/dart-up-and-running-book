An HTML version of this book is online:

Repo and testing info
-----------
As of February 2013, this is our primary repository for the book. We copy the .xml files to the private
O'Reilly repo from time to time; we expect them to publish from their repo every few months.

Currently, drone.io tests only whether the .dart files under **code/** pass static analysis (dart_analyzer).
We could do real unit testing, and we could do better with HTML samples.
In the future, we might want to test whether the .xml files are valid.
The command for that would be something like this:

    xmllint --postvalid --xinclude --noout book.xml

Updating the dartlang.org copy of this book
------------------
Basically, you get the dartlang.org project, and you run `make book`.
See https://github.com/dart-lang/www.dartlang.org#readme for details.

Issues and suggestions
----------------------
If you'd like to notify us about an issue in the book or if you'd like to sugguest changes please use the [www.dartlang.org issue tracker](https://github.com/dart-lang/www.dartlang.org).

Project structure
---------------------

	Figures and images.

**README.md:**
	This file.

**\*.xml:** 
	Book contents. **book.xml** is the entry point for the book, from an
